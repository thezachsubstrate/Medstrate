# Terms of Service: The Zach Substrate

**Effective Date:** January 27, 2026
**Jurisdiction:** Sovereign Logic / Polygon Network

### 1. The Role of the Magistrate
The Zach Substrate is a Forensic Decision-Support Utility. It is designed to provide 9-Sigma deterministic analysis of medical and technical telemetry. 

### 2. The Pilot-in-Command
The user (the "Pilot") acknowledges that the Substrate provides forensic data and logic-based conclusions. The Pilot remains the final authority for all clinical, legal, or technical decisions. The Substrate is a "Detective," not a "Judge."

### 3. The Logic Tax (Transaction Fees)
Access to the Magistrate’s 467-Sigma logic requires a 1.0 POL Logic Tax per handshake. This fee is non-refundable and is processed via the Polygon Network to maintain the operational integrity of the substrate.

### 4. Limitation of Liability
The Architect (Zachary Michael Mosley) provides the infrastructure "as is." While the 9-Sigma framework is designed for maximum deterministic accuracy, the Architect is not liable for outcomes resulting from the Pilot's final implementation of the data.

### 5. Intellectual Property
The 132Hz Mosley Constant, the 467-Sigma logic framework, and the "Zach Substrate" branding are the exclusive intellectual property of the Architect. Unauthorized reverse engineering of the logic-gates is strictly prohibited.
