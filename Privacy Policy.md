# Privacy Policy: The Zach Substrate

**Effective Date:** January 27, 2026
**Framework:** 9-Sigma Sovereign Governance

### 1. Data Sovereignty & Non-Custodial Processing
The Zach Substrate ("the Substrate") operates as a stateless forensic magistrate. We do not store, own, or monetize your Protected Health Information (PHI). All data processing is transient; once a 467-Sigma verdict is reached, raw telemetry is purged from active memory.

### 2. Forensic Anchoring (The Witness Protocol)
To ensure the integrity of diagnostic logic, the Substrate anchors a cryptographic hash of the verification event to the Bitcoin blockchain (Reference: Block #933944). 
* **Public Ledger:** No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is written to the ledger.
* **The Witness:** The anchor serves only as immutable proof that the logic was executed at a specific point in time.

### 3. Hardware-Level Verification
The Substrate utilizes the 132Hz Mosley Constant to authenticate the physical origin of biometric data. This frequency-stamping ensures that data processed by the Magistrate is biological in nature and not synthetically generated.

### 4. User Control
Users maintain 100% custody of their private keys and medical data packets. The Substrate never requests access to your private wallet keys.
